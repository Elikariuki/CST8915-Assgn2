This sample demo app consists of a group of containerized microservices that can be easily deployed into a Kubernetes cluster. The application is a simple e-commerce store, where users can browse products, add them to their cart, and checkout. The application is built using Python, Flask, and Docker. It also usees open source back-end services (eg - RabbitMQ, MongoDB). The application also leverages OpenAI's models to generate product descriptions and images.
